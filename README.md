Data Analysis on Otodom Real Estate Price Data
This README file provides an overview of the data analysis project conducted on Otodom real estate price data. In this project, we used Python for data analysis, and we stored the data in a Snowflake data warehouse. We also executed queries on Snowflake to extract valuable insights and answers to various questions related to real estate prices.

Project Overview
Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Otodom, a prominent real estate listing platform. It contains information about real estate listings, including property details, location, price, and more.

Tools Used
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Snowflake: For data warehousing and querying.
Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: We started by cleaning the raw data to ensure it was in a suitable format for analysis. This involved handling missing values, data type conversions, and removing duplicates.

Price Analysis: We analyzed property prices to answer questions such as:

What is the average price of properties in different regions?
How do property prices vary by property type (apartments, houses, etc.)?
Are there any seasonal trends in real estate prices?
Location Analysis: We explored location-related questions such as:

Which regions have the highest number of listings?
What is the distribution of property types in different regions?
Are there any regions with a significant price increase over time?
Feature Engineering: We created new features, if necessary, to enhance our analysis. For example, we might have calculated price per square meter.

Snowflake Data Warehousing: We stored the cleaned and processed data in a Snowflake data warehouse for efficient querying and analysis.

Querying Snowflake: We used SQL queries to extract insights from the Snowflake warehouse. This included complex queries to answer specific questions.


Running the Analysis
To replicate this data analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Access the Snowflake data warehouse and configure the necessary connection details.

Execute the Python scripts and SQL queries provided in the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis.

Conclusion
This data analysis project on Otodom real estate price data aimed to provide insights into real estate trends and answer questions related to property prices and locations. The combination of Python for data analysis and Snowflake for data warehousing allowed us to perform a thorough analysis and extract valuable information.

Note: Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and licenses for accessing and using the Otodom data and Snowflake services.
